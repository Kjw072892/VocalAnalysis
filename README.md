# Purpose
This project was created to help Transgender individual with their voice training.

Many programs online either only focus on a small portion of how a voice gets gendered, 
and not take into consideration different facets of how a voice is gendered.

My goal was to create a piece of software that is very easy and user-friendly. 
All you have to do is run the python script, select your voice recorder, and you'll
get a scatter plot of all the different facets of your voice from vowel pronunciation, 
timbre, vocal pitch [low, high, average], formant's [low, high, average], and outputs the data with a brief 
explanation
of what each data point represents on to a window3.

# Goals
My goal is to eventually incorporate a complete GUI for ease of use and a very user-friendly experience
