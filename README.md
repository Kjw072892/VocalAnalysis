# Purpose
This project was created to help Transgender individual with their voice training.

Many programs online either only focuses on a small portion of how a voice gets gendered, 
and not take into consideration different faccets of how a voice is gendered.

My goal was to create a piece of software that is very easy and user friendly. 
All you have to do is run the python script, select your voice recorder, and youll
get a scatter plot of all the different faccets of your voice from vowel pronounciation, 
timbre, vocal pitch [low, high, average], and outputs all the data with a brief explanation
of what each data point represents.

# Goals
My goal is to eventually incorporate a complete GUI for ease of use and a very user friendly experience
